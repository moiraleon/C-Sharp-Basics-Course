namespaces act similar to packages in java they are are a collection of similar classes and exist for organizational purposes
on a higher level exists assemblies which are a container that hold related namespaces

Declaring Variables and Constants
//C# is a case sensitive language
int number;
int Number = 1;
const float Pi = 3.14f;

//names of identifiers or variables can not start with a number 
3littlePigs XXX  NO
//cannot include pre identifiers but can use @ symbol if needed
int XXX NO
@int YYY OK

Naming Conventions in C#
Camel case -- firstName -- use for local variables
Pascal ---FirstName --use for constants

XXX
Hungarian Notation -- strFirstName (prefixed variable with data type) --DON'T USE in C#

Primitive Types

byte
short
int
long
float
double
decimal
char
bool


How to Declare Primitive Types
float number = 1.2f;
decimal number = 1.2m;

Non Primitive Types

String,Array, Enum, Class

Overflowing
happens when you exceed the boundary of the byte data type
to prevent use checked key word

checked{
    byte number = 255;
    number = number +1;
}

will instead throw and exception 
///likely you will never run in to this
